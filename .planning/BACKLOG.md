# BACKLOG

MEDIUM-and-below findings. Per the Phase 20A amended termination rules these are
**logged and explicitly DO NOT BLOCK execution**. CRITICAL and HIGH findings do not
belong here — they must be fixed or disproved, and they live in the owning phase's
baseline or summary.

Each entry names the plan that found it, the evidence, and why it is non-blocking.

## From 20A-01 (native Windows/macOS UAT — measure and wire)

### M6 — self-hosted CI contention · MEDIUM · NON-BLOCKING

**Found by:** 20A-01 Task 2 (Wiring A), and pre-registered in the plan's own verification
section.

**What.** 20A-01 added `plan/f20-unified-audit-repair` to `ci.yml`'s `push` trigger so
the branch reaches CI at all. `ci.yml`'s Windows leg runs on
`[self-hosted, Windows, X64, msvc]` — the SAME physical box (`SEANDESKTOP`) that
20A-01 Task 3 measures on and that 20A-02, 20A-03 and 20A-04 all use. The new
`windows-live-acceptance` nightly job added by Wiring C runs there too.

Nothing in this phase serializes them. A CI run triggered by a push can compete with a
measurement in progress for the box, for a cargo target directory, and for any
live-sandbox resource (AppContainer profiles, Job Objects, `%PUBLIC%` test dirs — note
`live_fs_acl.rs` seeds under `%PUBLIC%` and `hard_process_containment_windows.rs`
manipulates real process trees, so two concurrent runs are not merely slow, they can
interfere).

**Why non-blocking.** It degrades measurement *reliability*, not correctness of the
code under test, and it is detectable after the fact.

**Action if it bites.** If a measurement produces an inexplicable result, check
contention FIRST — before diagnosing the code. `gh run list -R FerroxLabs/wayland-core`
for an overlapping run, and re-measure on a quiet box.

### F-06 — the Windows box was not pristine when found · LOW · NON-BLOCKING

**Found by:** 20A-01 Task 1, pristine-tree check (REQ-native-r15).

**Evidence.** `C:\ferrox-win` at `ce9a11a6`:

```
$ cmd /c "git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all"
?? crates/wcore-swarm/.swarm-status.json
```

One untracked `wcore-swarm` run artifact, left behind by an earlier measurement. It was
recorded, then removed **by exact path** (never `git clean`, which inside a worktree
deletes branch-committed files), and the tree re-verified empty before anything was
measured.

**Why non-blocking.** It was caught by the pristine check that exists for exactly this
reason, and it was cleaned before any measurement was taken. No result in
`20A-01-BASELINE.md` was measured against a tainted tree.

**Latent issue worth a cheap fix (not done here — out of 20A-01's scope fence).**
`crates/wcore-swarm/.swarm-status.json` is a runtime artifact that is **not**
gitignored, so every `wcore-swarm` run dirties the checkout. That directly threatens the
clean-checkout precondition of `f20-native-windows-proof.ps1`, which hard-throws
`native F20 acceptance requires a clean checkout` on ANY porcelain output including
untracked files. **This is a plausible contributing cause of the checkout-dirty item
routed to 20A-03** — worth checking there before diagnosing anything more exotic.

### F-08 — `wayland-e2e-windows-soak.ps1` does not parse under Windows PowerShell 5.1 · LOW · NON-BLOCKING

**Found by:** 20A-01 Task 2, while proving the modified script still parses on real Windows.

**Evidence.** Parsing with `[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile`:

| Interpreter | Original script (`2a9d47ff`) | After 20A-01 Wiring B+C (`95552f64`) |
|---|---|---|
| `powershell` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) | **7 errors** | **8 errors** |
| `pwsh` (PowerShell 7) | **0 errors** | **0 errors** |

The 5.1 errors land in code 20A-01 never touched (PHASE H's `cargo mutants --list`, script
lines ~301-302), and the original file already fails identically. Cause: the script uses
non-ASCII characters (`═══` phase banners, `✓`, `✗`, `·` status glyphs) and Windows
PowerShell 5.1 decodes the BOM-less UTF-8 file as ANSI, corrupting string literals. The
extra 8th error is simply the additional `Write-Note` glyphs PHASE L adds — the same
artifact, not a new syntax defect.

**Why non-blocking.** Every consumer invokes `pwsh` (PowerShell 7), where the script
parses cleanly: `nightly-windows-soak.yml` uses `shell: pwsh` and calls
`pwsh scripts/wayland-e2e-windows-soak.ps1`, and the script's own help text documents
`pwsh scripts/...` as the local invocation. The 5.1 failure is unreachable in practice.

**Cheap fix if anyone cares:** save the file as UTF-8 **with** BOM, or replace the glyphs
with ASCII. Not done in 20A-01 — it is neither a defect on the runner that runs it nor
inside this plan's scope fence.

### F-11 — three CI jobs cancelled mid-flight, cause not established · LOW · NON-BLOCKING

**Found by:** 20A-01 Task 2 (Wiring A), on the branch's first CI run (`30151510189`).

`CI (macos-latest)` (at step 8), `CI (linux-containerized)` and
`Build (aarch64-pc-windows-msvc)` all concluded **cancelled** while `CI (Array)` concluded
**failure**. Neither obvious explanation fits:

- **Not concurrency `cancel-in-progress`** — `gh run list` for this branch shows exactly
  ONE run and no second push occurred.
- **Not matrix fail-fast** — the `ci` job sets `fail-fast: false`, and `macos-latest` and
  `Array` are both cells of that matrix.

Recorded as an open question rather than guessed at. Re-running the macOS job
(`gh run rerun --job 89662563384`) cleared it and the job reached step 11 normally, so the
cancellation appears transient rather than structural.

**Why non-blocking.** A retry resolved it, and it costs a re-run rather than any code
change.

**Watch for it.** If jobs cancel again on this branch without an explaining push, look at
run-level cancellation and at BACKLOG **M6** (self-hosted contention) together — the
Windows leg shares a box with every downstream measurement.

### F-07 — the `c39f7254` / `ce9a11a6` record discrepancy · INFO · RESOLVED, NO ACTION

**Found by:** 20A-01 Task 1.

The plan flagged that `.planning/TEST-AUDIT.md` records the Windows box at `ce9a11a6`
while this session's measurements were labelled `c39f7254`, and instructed the executor
to record what the box actually prints. The box printed `ce9a11a6`. The two records do
not conflict on substance:

```
$ /usr/bin/git merge-base --is-ancestor c39f7254 ce9a11a6                        -> YES
$ /usr/bin/git diff --stat c39f7254 ce9a11a6 -- crates/ .github/ scripts/ justfile .config/
  (empty)
```

Identical code trees. The measurements attributed to `c39f7254` were taken on exactly
the tree the box was standing on. Labelling artefact, not a measurement hazard. No
action; recorded so nobody re-litigates it.
