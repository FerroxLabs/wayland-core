issue: 1269
repo: FerroxLabs/wayland
kind: defect
title: "Unmerged lane/f13-* branches held out of 0.13.12: four carry work integ lacks, two await their owning lane, five archived as redundant"
status: open

criteria:
  - id: c1
    text: "Each of the four 'carries work `integ` lacks' branches reaches a terminal state: merged after an adversarial pass, archived with the reason recorded, or filed as its own ticket. None is left as a bare branch."

State is not-met because no lane has claimed it and nothing in the tree has been graded against this text. kind is defect, not task, because the gate reserves task for a credential, an account or a platform a human must obtain and there is code behind this one."

Created 2026-08-31 to close a COVERAGE gap. It records no work as done.

`scripts/check-criteria-ledger.py` scopes every open `area:core` issue on
wayland and EVERY open issue on wayland-core. This issue was in scope from
the moment it was filed and had no ledger file, so
`scripts/check-release-readiness.py` -- which reads ledger files and nothing
else -- could not count it. CI runs the coverage gate with `--offline`, the
arm that would have reported the gap, so nothing said so for two days.

Criteria are transcribed from the issue body without edit. Where the body's
wording is loose it is LEFT loose rather than tightened here: sharpening a
criterion inside the ledger is how a criterion quietly becomes an easier
adjacent property. Whoever takes this restates it on the ISSUE first.
