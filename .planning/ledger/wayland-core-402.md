Created 2026-08-31 to close a COVERAGE gap. It records no work as done.

`scripts/check-criteria-ledger.py` scopes every open `area:core` issue on
wayland and EVERY open issue on wayland-core. This issue was in scope from
the moment it was filed and had no ledger file, so
`scripts/check-release-readiness.py` -- which reads ledger files and nothing
else -- could not count it. CI runs the coverage gate with `--offline`, the
arm that would have reported the gap, so nothing said so for two days.

Criteria are transcribed from the issue body without edit. Where the body's
wording is loose it is LEFT loose rather than tightened here: sharpening a
criterion inside the ledger is how a criterion quietly becomes an easier
adjacent property. Whoever takes this restates it on the ISSUE first.
