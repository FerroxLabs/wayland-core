kind: defect
title: "ErrorInfo.category is unknown on the in-band emit_error seam and across the sub-agent relay, where the raising code knew better"
status: open
last_verified_commit: 4a738f2e
criteria:
  - id: c1

This ledger did not exist until now: the issue was filed 2026-08-29/30 by this cycle's own verification and never entered the release gate, which counts only issues holding a ledger file. State is not-met because no lane has claimed it and nothing in the tree has been graded against this text. kind is defect, not task, because the gate reserves task for a credential, an account or a platform a human must obtain and there is code behind this one."

Created 2026-08-31 to close a COVERAGE gap. It records no work as done.

`scripts/check-criteria-ledger.py` scopes every open `area:core` issue on
wayland and EVERY open issue on wayland-core. This issue was in scope from
the moment it was filed and had no ledger file, so
`scripts/check-release-readiness.py` -- which reads ledger files and nothing
else -- could not count it. CI runs the coverage gate with `--offline`, the
arm that would have reported the gap, so nothing said so for two days.

Criteria are transcribed from the issue body without edit. Where the body's
wording is loose it is LEFT loose rather than tightened here: sharpening a
criterion inside the ledger is how a criterion quietly becomes an easier
adjacent property. Whoever takes this restates it on the ISSUE first.
