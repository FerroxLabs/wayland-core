issue: 1268
repo: FerroxLabs/wayland
kind: defect
title: "The #1248 notice path IS reachable on Windows: a structural-impossibility claim contradicts atomic_io.rs's own correction (split from #1248)"
status: open
last_verified_commit: 4a738f2e
criteria:
  - id: c1
    text: "The false sentence is corrected wherever it is committed — `write.rs`, `edit.rs`'s reference to it, and the `wayland-1248` ledger note — and the corrected text states the real reason the tests are gated (no Windows executor in this workspace), not a structural impossibility."

    note: "Transcribed from the issue body verbatim on 2026-08-31. This ledger did not exist until now: the issue was filed 2026-08-29/30 by this cycle's own verification and never entered the release gate, which counts only issues holding a ledger file. State is not-met because no lane has claimed it and nothing in the tree has been graded against this text. kind is defect, not task, because the gate reserves task for a credential, an account or a platform a human must obtain and there is code behind this one."
  - id: c2
    text: "The `intercepted_save: Some(..)` path is exercised on Windows: either the two `the_vfs_*_path_names_a_save_the_refusal_displaced` tests are made to run on a Windows host, or a Windows-only test drives `atomic_write_checked` through a displaced save and asserts the surfaced text names the preserved file."

Created 2026-08-31 to close a COVERAGE gap. It records no work as done.

`scripts/check-criteria-ledger.py` scopes every open `area:core` issue on
wayland and EVERY open issue on wayland-core. This issue was in scope from
the moment it was filed and had no ledger file, so
`scripts/check-release-readiness.py` -- which reads ledger files and nothing
else -- could not count it. CI runs the coverage gate with `--offline`, the
arm that would have reported the gap, so nothing said so for two days.

Criteria are transcribed from the issue body without edit. Where the body's
wording is loose it is LEFT loose rather than tightened here: sharpening a
criterion inside the ledger is how a criterion quietly becomes an easier
adjacent property. Whoever takes this restates it on the ISSUE first.
