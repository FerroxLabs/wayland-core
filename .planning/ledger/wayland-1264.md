issue: 1264
repo: FerroxLabs/wayland
kind: defect
title: "Egress: an allowlisted apex is admitted on the host match alone, so tool-driven traffic is never shape-checked (split from #1195 c8)"
status: open
last_verified_commit: 4a738f2e
criteria:
  - id: c1
    text: "A decision is recorded in `.planning/DECISIONS.md` with its reasoning: either the allowlist grant is split by traffic origin (provider vs tool-driven), or the current posture is affirmed as intended and the reason is written down where an operator reading the egress policy can see it."
    state: not-met

    note: "Transcribed from the issue body verbatim on 2026-08-31. This ledger did not exist until now: the issue was filed 2026-08-29/30 by this cycle's own verification and never entered the release gate, which counts only issues holding a ledger file. State is not-met because no lane has claimed it and nothing in the tree has been graded against this text. kind is defect, not task, because the gate reserves task for a credential, an account or a platform a human must obtain and there is code behind this one."
  - id: c2
    text: "If the split is taken: tool-driven egress to an allowlisted host is shape-checked (method, path, query), and a test drives the real `WebFetch` surface against an allowlisted apex carrying a query payload, shown RED against today's `classify.rs:229` early return."

Created 2026-08-31 to close a COVERAGE gap. It records no work as done.

`scripts/check-criteria-ledger.py` scopes every open `area:core` issue on
wayland and EVERY open issue on wayland-core. This issue was in scope from
the moment it was filed and had no ledger file, so
`scripts/check-release-readiness.py` -- which reads ledger files and nothing
else -- could not count it. CI runs the coverage gate with `--offline`, the
arm that would have reported the gap, so nothing said so for two days.

Criteria are transcribed from the issue body without edit. Where the body's
wording is loose it is LEFT loose rather than tightened here: sharpening a
criterion inside the ledger is how a criterion quietly becomes an easier
adjacent property. Whoever takes this restates it on the ISSUE first.
